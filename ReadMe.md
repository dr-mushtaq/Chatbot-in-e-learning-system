|Title| Published Date| Research Questions| Model performance metrics|Research Gap|Taking Notes|Input/Target Features|Journal name/ Category|Limitations|Future Directions| 
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|**🌐1- The development of a chatbot using Convolutional Neural Networks**| 2022 |1.How do different CNN architectures impact chatbot performance?|1.Accuracy      2.Training Speed|Did author compared  CNN chatbot to simpler models or rule-based systems? How well does it handle complex or open ended questions?| |
|**🌐2- Machine learning algorithms for teaching AI chat bots** | 2021 |1. Which machine learning algorithms are most successful in training AI chatbots for various tasks?|N/A|The paper does not cover various methods for evaluating the effectiveness of chatbot training algorithms. How can we measure a chatbot's ability to hold natural conversations, understand user intent, and generate appropriate responses?|Microservice architecture is used and the speed of message processing and preparation of responses by the chatbot will not change depending on the load on the server and the number of incoming messages. |
|**🌐3- Personified Robotic Chatbot Based On Compositional Dialogues** | 2022 |Research likely doesn't focus on specific questions but rather explores how compositional dialogues (where conversations are built from smaller elements) can be used to create a personified robotic chatbot.|N/A|1. How effectively can the level of personality be measured in these chatbots?          2.Is user perception the only metric, or can objective measures be developed?| |
| **🌐4- Boosting the Accuracy of Optimization Chatbot by Random Forest with Halving Grid Search Hyperparameter Tuning**| 2023 |1.Can hyperparameter tuning with a Halving Grid Search method improve the accuracy of an optimization chatbot built using a Random Forest algorithm?|1.Accuracy    2.Precision    3.Recall  |The paper proposes three chatbot models: 1.One without hyperparameter tuning 2.One with hyperparameter tuning using Halving Grid Search 3.One with hyperparameter tuning and the best performing settings| |   
|**🌐5- Developing a Chatbot using Machine Learning**| 2019|1.Can machine learning algorithms improve the ability of a chatbot to understand natural language queries?  2. How does the choice of machine learning model (e.g., recurrent neural networks, decision trees) impact the performance of a chatbot?|1. BLEU Score (BiLingual Evaluation Understudy)  2.Turing Test|This paper does not Investigate the impact of different visual design elements on user attention and engagement with the chatbot.| |
|**🌐6- Designing a Chatbot for Contemporary Education: A Systematic Literature Review**| 2023|What are the steps for designing an educational chatbot for contemporary education?|N/A|It focuses on the development of chatbots for education, not the impact on learners or educators.| |
|**🌐7- Research on the Design of Intelligent Chatbot Based on Deep Learning** | 2021 |It  is likely centered around improving the response generation of chatbots built with deep learning techniques.|N/A|Research gaps could exist in areas like sentiment analysis and generation of emotionally responsive dialogue.|Paper proposes an improved two-way GRU + Attention model based on the idea of mutual information, and examines the quality of the model from the final response effect. |
|**🌐8- Question Answering Model Based Conversational Chatbot using BERT Model and Google Dialogflow** | 2021 |N/A|N/A|The focus might be on question answering. Future research could explore integrating functionalities like sentiment analysis to tailor responses to user emotions or incorporating functionalities for completing tasks beyond just answering questions.|The focus of the paper seems to be on building and demonstrating the feasibility of a question-answering chatbot using BERT and Dialogflow. It describes the architecture and functionalities of the chatbot|
|**🌐9- Chatbot : A Question Answering System for Student** | 2021|It suggests the research question that  revolves around developing a chatbot system that effectively functions as a question answering system for students.|N/A|N/A|Paper discusses the design and development of such a chatbot, including the challenges of creating a system that can understand and answer student queries effectively.|
|**🌐10-QAM: Question Answering System Based on Knowledge Graph in the Military** | 2020|How can a knowledge graph-based Question Answering System (QAM) be effectively designed to be used in the military domain?|N/A|Slice of words not included in the JIEBA will be divide, which cause that the following steps can’t accuracy judged. And some unclear words often led to the system failed to judge the right answer and return a wrong answer to the user.|Research used the tool of NEO4J to build the military KG as well python to construct QA system|
